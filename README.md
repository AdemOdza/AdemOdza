I'm Adem Odza, and I am studying Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas (in Richardson). I expect to graduate in Spring of 2023, and I plan on going to graduate school soon after that. 

I find machine learning very interesting and really enjoy learning about it. I hope to one day do research relating to linguistics and Natural Language Processing using machine learning.

I am currently working on a Rust natural language processing crate that I am using as a way to both learn Rust and create a meaningful NLP project.
