## About me

I'm Adem Odza, and I am studying Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas (in Richardson). I expect to graduate in Spring of 2023, and I have plans to attend graduate school after receiving my Bachelor's degree.

## Interests

I find machine learning very interesting and really enjoy learning about it. I hope to one day do research relating to linguistics and Natural Language Processing using machine learning.


## Projects
I am currently working on a Rust natural language processing crate that I am using as a way to both learn Rust and create a meaningful NLP project.

Other than that, I have done a few other projects relating to machine learning and web development. These can all be found on my profile.
