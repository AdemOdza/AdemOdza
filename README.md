I'm Adem Odza, and I am studying Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas (At Richardson!). I expect to graduate in Spring of 2023, and I plan on going to graduate school soon after that. 

I find machine learning very interesting and really enjoy learning about it. I hope to one day do research relating to linguistics using machine learning and NLP.
